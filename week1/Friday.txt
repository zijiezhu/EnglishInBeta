Maybe some of you have heard of GiMabic,
 
He was a matronly baseball player
 
He won the gold metal in Olympics
 
He played for the Yankees, the Andrews
 
But he threw a no header and he only has one arm
 
When he was a kid 
 
He came home mad one time told his Dad,
 
The kids won't let me play the baseball bc I only have one hand
 
His dad replied no the kids won't let you play baseball bc you stink at baseball
 
You can't change the fact that you only have one hand 
 
But you can change the fact that you stink
 
So that begins the practice with him and he got good
 
He overcomes obstacles 
 
Teams was trying to exploit his weak side 
 
They were trying to bound the side that he had a missing arm
 
But they never succeed bc he practice and practice 
 
Feeling bounds to that side



Maybe some of you have heard of Jim Abbot,

He was a Major League  baseball player

He won a gold medal in the Olympics

He played for the Yankees, the Angels

But he threw a no-hitter and he only has one arm

When he was a kid 

He came home mad one time and told his Dad,

The kids won't let me play the baseball bc I only have one hand

His dad replied no the kids won't let you play baseball bc you stink at baseball

You can't change the fact that you only have one hand 

But you can change the fact that you stink

So his dad began to practice with him and he got good

He overcame obstacles 

Teams would try to exploit his weak side 

They would try to bunt to the side that he had a missing arm

But they never succeeded bc he practiced and practiced

Fielding bunts to that side
