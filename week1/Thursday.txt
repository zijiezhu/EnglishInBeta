As you can see, I was born without fingers on my right hand 

And also my right leg was several inches shorter than my left one.

They broke the bones in the leg, then they skewed the metal bags into the bone 

It has not only spice but wired all the way the leg to be stable

I have to walk on it, I have to stretch it out so my muscles don't just get atrophy 

People always ask me " does it hurt?" 

Yes, it does

But I focus on what I do, not what I can not do 

I want to talk with you guys about overcoming obstacles 

Everybody has obstacles, disability, a herdo

We face the choices, let the obstacle overcome you or overcome the obstacle.
