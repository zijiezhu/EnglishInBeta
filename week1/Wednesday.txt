So the idea of master learning is to do the exact opposite

They say artificially constraining, when and how long, fixing when and how long you work on something

Pretty much ensuring the variable outcome, the A B C D F

And do it another way around

What's variable is when and how long the student has to work on something 

And what's fixed is that they actually master the material 

And it's important to realize, that's not only make the student learn their exponent better

But it reinforced the right mindset muscle s

Next they realized, if you got 20 percent wrong on something

And it doesn't mean you have a C brained in your DNA somehow

It means you should just keep working on it, you should have grit, you should have perseverance , and take agency over your learn
